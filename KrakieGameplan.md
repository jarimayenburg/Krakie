## The story so far...

Krakie wants to tread in his father's footsteps. Kraakster, Krakie's dad, once was the most notorious thief in the world. 
He was the thief who managed to steal the Platinum Bill, the Crystal Amber, Zonk's Magnum Opus and managed to almost steal the most valuable prize of them all:
the Golden egg. Unfortunately, Kraakster was shot and killed by police commander Stoerie while trying to extract the golden egg from the highly secure vault: the Chicken coop. 
Kraakster's motive for stealing all those items is still unknown to this day. Krakie always believed his dad stole those items to become the greatest thief alive, but Krakie doesn't 
know the great mystery behind his father's actions. Krakie found the schematics of how his father planned his heists and decided to try and become the greatest thief ever known.
The first mission that his dad wrote about was the heist of the Platinum Bill. This one is stored in the Richest Bank of them All, at least that's what they call themselves, the Platinum
Bill.

## Mission 1: Bank
This mission takes place in the Richest Bank of them All. The CEO of the bank is called: Mister WB (Wanky Banky) and he once came into the possession of the Platinum Bill.
